    "Snow is an important component in the Earth’s hydrological and energy cycles. "
    "Snowpack functions as a natural reservoir that stores water in cold months and slowly releases water into streams, rivers, and lakes, substantially mitigating water stress during the summer. Snow is one of the most reflective land cover types on the Earth’s surface and has positive feedback on climate warming."
    "Temperature increases accelerate snowmelt rate and reduce snow-covered area, SCA, leading to a lower land surface reflectance. More solar radiation will be absorbed by the land surface, which in turn accelerates climate warming. Snow-covered area (SCA) is a critical variable for studying land processes such as snow-albedo feedback at different spatial scales, impacts on plant phenology and other associated environmental processes, and is also used in land surface models." 
   "Therefore, to better understand water availability and the Earth’s energy balance, it is important to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of the snowpack.\n"
