    "The model has been adapted to the open-source workflow management sytem, [GeoWeaver](https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver). Geoweaver is a web-based application for interactive, full-stack machine leanring workflow management. The app provdies a user-friendly GUI to interact with and persistently store script logs and code revision histories. Shell and python scripts are supported by the platform, as well as seammless intergration wth Jupyter. \n",

A full-stack workflow of the model can be found at the github page, [here](https://github.com/AlabamaWaterInstitute/National-Snow-Model/tree/main/tutorials). After downloading the zip folder, import the JSON workflow file to Geoweaver using the \"import wrokflow\" tool in Weaver and the model will be displayed in the weaver window.

Each node in the workflow has been assigned to a stage in the model devlopment and exectuition process, from training to interactive SWE mapping. Python scripts of each node may be interacted with under the Processes header. Any edits to processes made here will be relected in the Weaver node and a history of revisions saved in Geoweaver. \n",

    "Training stages of the model can take a long time to execute on a personal computer. The donwloaded model has already undergone trianing, so these steps are not neccessary to perform for the prediction stages of the model. A node may be skipped by double-clicking and selecting \"skip\". Skipped nodes will appear greyed out. Before exectuion it is necessary to update the line below in the Folder_Path process to point to the root folder containing the data and models.\n",

As it runs, you may click into a process to view the logs in real time to see any output or messages. If you run the ANN training scripts, you will see matplotlib popups as would normally in python. You can see here how the model performance is improved before and after the feature space optimization. Note that these popups must be closed by the user to progress the workflow. \n",
